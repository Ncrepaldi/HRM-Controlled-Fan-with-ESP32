First of all, big shootout to Jonathan (jludwig75) from which I took the inspiration for the code. Also, big thanks to the OpenAi team for their ChatGPT which I extensively used.

It must be said that i have NO background or specific knowledge about coding, nor I know or understand anything of C++ or Python. I am just curious and have very basics electrical/electronics knowledge. Therefore, almost everybody could do this project.
